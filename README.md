# EdgeTX Notes

Lua script for EdgeTX/OpenTX to display notes on a B/W screen.
It was inspired by [Ulf's simple image viewer](https://www.schleth.com/fpv/vu-a-simple-image-viewer-for-edgetx-radios-with-big-screens-2113.html)
but unfortunately it doesn't worked for my Boxer radio, I needed some other solution.


# Installation

Place the script [EdgeTXNotes.lua](EdgeTXNotes.lua) into your `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/` directory
of the SDCard from your Radio. Then create a directory `/NOTES`.

If the `/NOTES` directory is empty, the script will create a common set of files for you.
You can place what ever text file you will. The Name of the file must use the suffix `*.txt`
